## Plugins 
Several plugins were used in this prototype. In the following I will name these plugins and their function.

| Plug in | Function | URL |
|--|--|--|
| A11y - Color Contrast Checker | This plugin checks the color contrast ratio of all visible text in a frame, and it provides feedback on whether it meets WCAGâ€™s AA and/or AAA level compliance. It also provides color sliders that allow users to adjust the colors and understand how the corresponding contrast ratio changes in real-time. | https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733159460536249875/A11y---Color-Contrast-Checker |
